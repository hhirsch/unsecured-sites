# Site Unsecure

This Website is not secured with SSL. User Passwords are transfered in plain text visible for people on their network and everyone in between them and the website.

SSL certificates are cheap and there are even free ones. It takes about 10 minutes to set up an SSL-Certificate so there is no reason to broadcast confidential data.
